						<h2>Detect communitied within the word of Dota</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						In the game of Dota, when a player is about to start a game, the region will be 
						automatically selected from a predefined set of regions (length of this list: ~20) based on IP address.
						Our hypotheses is that using the Louvain-algorithm the detection of different communities is possible.
					</p>
					<div style="text-align:center">
						<img src="images/regions.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					<p>
						After running the algorithm, it detected around 10 communities between the pro players we are working with.
						To make the results more exciting and expressive, istead of displaying the user_ids we decided to work with the country 
						code of these players, make a set of them. With the help of an external API, the country codes were transformed to country names.
						Just a few of these communities were presented here. 
					</p>
					<div style="text-align:center">
						<img src="images/community_res.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					<p>
						Note that some countries appear in multiple communities, the reason for this is that there are players who are located for 
						example in Australia but plays most of the time with players from eastern countries. Because of this particular case 
						Australia will appear in the eastern community. But there will be another Australian player who may play within his/her own country.
						In this case Australia as a country will also appear in the region of Australia.
